# Calculation Details

## Expedition  
### How do we figure out your share ?
To estimate how much $MITO you might get, I have been using a weighted approach taking into account your nomber of points and your tier (Diamond, Platinum, Gold, etc...)

Therefore, we need several info to fix variables:
1. Your points — how many points you earned in the game.
2. Your tier — how well you did compared to others.
3. The total number of points generated by the total number of participants
4. The average bonus multiplier, taking into account the multiplying factors to be applied for each tier

### Determining variables      


1. Your points are automatically extracted from your wallet adress using Mitosis API.
2. Same for your tier level.
3. To estimate the total number of points is a bit trickier, since this information is not publicly available...

We don’t know the exact number, but we have clues:

Clue 1: The top player
He/She deposited about 100 ETH and has 2.75 billion points (beginning of May 2025).

So that means that, on average, 1 ETH = ~27 million points, if you had the best bonuses.

Clue 2: The total ETH locked in the system
On DefiLlama, Mitosis, beginning of May 2025 again, shows about 13,740 ETH total (TVL = total value locked).

Now we can try to guess:
If all users got the same top bonus:
13,740 ETH × 27 million = 371 billion points → too high. That’s unrealistic. Most people earned less per ETH.

So, trying to have a fair estimate between high and low performers and taking into account the distribution shown in leaderboard for top 100 holders, we can try to base our estimate on the assumption that the average ETH earned ~15 million points.

Therefore, total number of points would be: 13740 x 15M = about 206B, let's take 225B to be on the safe side of the estimation.

4. Then, I have applied typical tier bonuses for DeFi / Crypto projects (higher tier = bigger bonus):

Then, let's take an average tier bonus value of 1.5 for the total number of particpants, again, probably on the safe side.


Total points from everyone ≈ 225 billion and
Average tier bonus across everyone ≈ 1.5

Taking into account
225B×1.5=337.5B

We end up with:
